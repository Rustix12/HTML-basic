    <h1 id="title">Bee</h1>

    <p class="info">Bees are flying insects known for their role in pollination and for producing honey and beeswax. They belong to the order Hymenoptera and the family Apidae. There are over 20,000 species of bees, with honeybees (Apis mellifera), bumblebees (Bombus spp.), and solitary bees being the most well-known.</p>

    <h2 class="h2">Physical Characteristics</h2>
    <p class="info">Bees have a distinctive body structure divided into three main parts: the head, thorax, and abdomen. They have two pairs of wings, six legs, and large compound eyes that help them navigate and find flowers. Their bodies are often covered in fine hairs that help collect pollen.</p>

   

    <h2 class="h2">Pollination and importance</h2>
    <p class="info" id="img">Bees play a crucial role in pollination, which helps plants reproduce. As they collect nectar and pollen from flowers, they transfer pollen between plants, enabling fruit and seed production. Many crops, such as apples, almonds, and berries, rely on bees for pollination.</p>

    <h2 class="h2">Honey and Beeswax Production</h2>

    <p id="img2">Honeybees produce honey by collecting nectar, which they store in honeycombs. Enzymes in their saliva break down the nectar, turning it into honey. Beeswax is secreted by worker bees and used to construct honeycomb cells.</p>

    <p class="info">Bee populations are declining due to habitat loss, pesticide use, climate change, and diseases like Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Conservation efforts, such as planting bee-friendly flowers and reducing pesticide use, are essential for protecting bee populations.</p>
