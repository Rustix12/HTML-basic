    <h2>Some of the most influenced players from this countries</h2>

<h2>Pele:</h2>

<p class="info" id="pele">Pelé, born Edson Arantes do Nascimento on October 23, 1940, in Três Corações, Brazil, is regarded as one of the greatest footballers in history. From a young age, he displayed extraordinary talent, and by the time he was a teenager, he had already begun making waves in Brazilian football. His breakthrough came in the 1958 FIFA World Cup when, at just 17 years old, he led Brazil to victory, becoming the youngest player ever to score in a World Cup final. His dazzling dribbling, powerful shots, and incredible vision on the field made him a formidable force, earning him admiration from football lovers around the world. Pelé went on to win two more World Cups, in 1962 and 1970, making him the only player in history to lift the trophy three times. His performance in the 1970 World Cup, where he orchestrated Brazil’s attack with elegance and skill, is still considered one of the greatest displays of football ever seen.

    At the club level, Pelé spent most of his career with Santos FC, a Brazilian club where he achieved legendary status. He led Santos to numerous domestic and international titles, including multiple Campeonato Brasileiro championships and two Copa Libertadores titles. During his time with the club, Santos became one of the most dominant teams in world football, often touring internationally to showcase their brilliance. Pelé's goal-scoring ability was unmatched, and he recorded more than 1,000 career goals, a milestone that few players have reached. His impact was not just about numbers; he played with grace, creativity, and an unmatched ability to read the game, making him a joy to watch.
    
    In the 1970s, Pelé took on a new challenge by joining the New York Cosmos in the North American Soccer League (NASL). Although he was past his prime, his arrival helped popularize football in the United States, drawing massive crowds and increasing the sport’s visibility in a country where it was not yet widely followed. He played a crucial role in growing the game’s influence in North America, inspiring future generations of American footballers. Even after retiring, Pelé remained deeply connected to the sport, serving as a global ambassador for football and using his influence to promote peace and unity.
    
    Beyond his achievements on the field, Pelé was known for his humility, sportsmanship, and dedication to spreading the joy of football. He received numerous awards and honors throughout his lifetime, including being named FIFA’s Player of the Century alongside Diego Maradona. His legacy goes beyond statistics and trophies—he symbolized the beauty of the game and the power of football to bring people together. Even after his passing in 2022, Pelé’s influence continues to inspire millions, ensuring that his name will forever be remembered as one of the greatest icons in the history of sports.

    <h2>Messi :</h2>

    <p class="info" id="messi">Lionel Messi, born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina, is widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time. From an early age, he displayed extraordinary talent, joining the youth system of FC Barcelona at just 13 years old after moving to Spain for treatment of a growth hormone deficiency. His rise through the ranks was meteoric, and by the time he made his first-team debut in 2004 at the age of 17, it was clear that he was destined for greatness. Over the next two decades, Messi redefined modern football with his dazzling dribbling, exceptional vision, and incredible goal-scoring ability. His low center of gravity, combined with unmatched agility and control, made him nearly impossible to stop. Whether weaving through defenders, delivering pinpoint assists, or scoring stunning goals, Messi consistently left fans and opponents in awe. During his time at Barcelona, he became the club’s all-time leading scorer, winning numerous La Liga and Champions League titles while forming legendary attacking partnerships with players like Xavi, Iniesta, and later Neymar and Suárez. He claimed a record-breaking number of Ballon d’Or awards, given to the world’s best player, further solidifying his status as an all-time great. However, for much of his career, the only thing missing was international success with Argentina, as heartbreaking defeats in major finals—including the 2014 World Cup final—led to criticism and doubt about his ability to replicate his club success on the world stage. Despite this, Messi never gave up on his country, and in 2021, he finally lifted his first major international trophy, leading Argentina to victory in the Copa América, a moment of pure redemption and joy. His crowning achievement came in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where he captained Argentina to glory, delivering breathtaking performances and securing his legacy as an undisputed legend. After leaving Barcelona in 2021 due to financial constraints, he joined Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), where he continued to showcase his brilliance. Off the field, Messi is known for his humility, dedication, and love for the game, making him not just a football icon but an inspiration to millions worldwide. His journey, from a small boy in Rosario with big dreams to conquering the footballing world, is a testament to his talent, perseverance, and passion for the sport, ensuring that his name will be remembered forever in the history of football.</p>
