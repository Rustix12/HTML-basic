<h1>History of Bangladesh</h1>

<h2>Language movement-
</h2>

<h3># Background-</h3>

<p>After the partition of India in 1947, Pakistan was created with two geographically separate regions: East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and West Pakistan (now Pakistan).
<br>
<br>

 The majority of the population in East Pakistan spoke Bengali, while Urdu was predominantly spoken in West Pakistan. Despite this, the government of Pakistan sought to establish Urdu as the sole state language, ignoring the linguistic identity of the majority population in East Pakistan.</p>


<h3># Key events-</h3>

<h4>1.1948 Declaration:</h4>
<p>The controversy began when the government of Pakistan announced that Urdu would be the only state language. This sparked protests in East Pakistan.

<br>
 On March 21, 1948, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the Governor-General of Pakistan, declared in Dhaka that "Urdu and only Urdu shall be the state language of Pakistan," which further inflamed tensions.</p>



<h4>2.1952 Protests:</h4>
<p>The movement gained momentum in 1952, particularly on February 21. Students and activists organized protests in Dhaka demanding recognition of Bengali as one of the state languages.

<br>
<br>
 On that day, police opened fire on peaceful demonstrators, killing several students, including Salam, Rafiq, Barkat, and Jabbar. Their sacrifice became a symbol of resistance and unity.</p>

 <h4>3.Victory for Bengali:</h4>

 
 <p>In 1956, the government of Pakistan finally recognized Bengali as one of the two state languages of Pakistan, alongside Urdu.</p>

 <h3># Legacy-</h3>

 <p>International Mother Language Day: In 1999, UNESCO declared February 21 as International Mother Language Day in recognition of the sacrifices made during the Bangladesh Language Movement.
<br> 
<br> 
    Cultural and Political Impact: The movement instilled a strong sense of national identity among Bengalis and paved the way for the independence movement of Bangladesh in 1971.

<br>
    Shaheed Minar: A memorial called Shaheed Minar was erected in Dhaka to honor the martyrs of the language movement. It remains a symbol of pride and sacrifice.</p>
<p>This movement is a significant chapter in the history of Bangladesh and a testament to the power of language in shaping cultural identity.
